<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a full professor in College of Information Engineering at Northwest A&F University, start from spring 2024. Before that, I was a tenure-track assistant professor at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2022, and received the B.E. degree in Electronic Information Engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2017.

Now I am leading the Multi-modal Topological Structure Analysis (MTSA) Lab, and  focus on graph machine learning, graph signal processing and multi-modal graph learning for science. The intersection between different disciplines often brings unexpected surprises, which is the biggest driving force of my research.

I'm always looking for self-motivated Ph.D and Master students, and visiting students. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me.
